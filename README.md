# FinalProject
This is a repository for my Final Project in INFO 4730

I wanted to try and make a repository that I possibly could use later in life as well as expand upon if needed. 
So I decided I would backup my own data as a repository. While in some cases it may benefit others in the process, 
I thought I could use this project to back up some of my old programing for school, work and gaming that I have 
created over the years. Thus giving me a reference to fall back on if I decide to write other code, or use old 
code as a template. I thought that this would also be handy allowing me to access the code anywhere I am.
